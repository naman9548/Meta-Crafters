Require Assert Revert Example 

This Solidity smart contract demonstrates the usage of require(), assert(), and revert() statements in Ethereum smart contract development.

Description

The contract provides three functions:

transfer: Allows users to transfer tokens from their account to another account.

assertExample: Demonstrates the usage of the assert() statement by adding two numbers and ensuring the result is greater than or equal to the first number.

revertExample: Demonstrates the usage of the revert() statement by preventing division by zero and reverting the transaction with a custom error message if the input value is zero.


Getting Started


To deploy and interact with this contract, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps:


Go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., RequireAssertRevertExample.sol).

Copy and paste the contract code into the file.

Compile the code by clicking on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.0" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile RequireAssertRevertExample.sol" button.

Deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "RequireAssertRevertExample" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Interact with the contract by calling its functions. You can transfer tokens, perform assertions, and test revert conditions.
